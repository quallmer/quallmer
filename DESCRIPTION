Description: Tools for AI-assisted qualitative data coding using large language
    models (LLMs). Provides a codebook-based workflow for defining coding
    instructions and applying them to texts, images, and other data. Includes
    built-in codebooks for common applications and functions for creating custom
    codebooks tailored to specific research questions. Supports replication across
    models and settings, computing inter-coder reliability and gold-standard
    validation metrics.
