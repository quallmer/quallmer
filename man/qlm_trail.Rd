\title{Extract provenance trail from quallmer objects}
\usage{
qlm_trail(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more quallmer objects (\code{qlm_coded}, \code{qlm_comparison}, or
\code{qlm_validation}). When multiple objects are provided, they will be used
to reconstruct the complete provenance chain.}
}
\value{
A \code{qlm_trail} object containing:
\describe{
\item{runs}{List of run information, ordered from oldest to newest}
\item{complete}{Logical indicating whether all parent references were resolved}
}
}
\description{
Extracts and displays the provenance chain from one or more \code{qlm_coded},
\code{qlm_comparison}, or \code{qlm_validation} objects. When multiple objects are
provided, attempts to reconstruct the full lineage by matching parent-child
relationships.
}
\details{
The provenance trail shows the history of coding runs, including:
\itemize{
\item Run name and parent relationship
\item Model and parameters used
\item Timestamp
\item Call that created the run
}

When a single object is provided, only its immediate lineage (name, parent,
timestamp) is shown. To see the full chain, provide all ancestor objects.

For branching workflows (e.g., when multiple coded objects are compared),
the trail captures all input runs as parents of the comparison.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Single run shows immediate info
coded1 <- qlm_code(reviews, codebook, model = "openai/gpt-4o")
qlm_trail(coded1)

# Create replication chain
coded2 <- qlm_replicate(coded1, model = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514")
coded3 <- qlm_replicate(coded2, temperature = 0.7)

# Reconstruct full chain
trail <- qlm_trail(coded3, coded2, coded1)
print(trail)

# Save for archival
qlm_trail_save(trail, "analysis_trail.rds")

# Export to JSON
qlm_trail_export(trail, "analysis_trail.json")
}
