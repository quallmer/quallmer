\title{Extract audit trail from quallmer objects}
\usage{
qlm_trail(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more quallmer objects (\code{qlm_coded}, \code{qlm_comparison}, or
\code{qlm_validation}). When multiple objects are provided, they will be used
to reconstruct the complete workflow chain.}
}
\value{
A \code{qlm_trail} object containing:

\describe{
\item{runs}{List of run information with coded data, ordered from oldest to newest}
\item{complete}{Logical indicating whether all parent references were resolved}
}
}
\description{
Creates a complete audit trail documenting your qualitative coding workflow.
Following Lincoln and Guba's (1985) concept of the audit trail for
establishing trustworthiness in qualitative research, this function captures
the full decision history of your AI-assisted coding process.
}
\details{
The audit trail captures the complete history of your coding workflow:
\itemize{
\item Run names and parent-child relationships
\item Models and parameters used at each step
\item Timestamps documenting when each step occurred
\item The actual coded results from each run
\item Comparison and validation metrics (when applicable)
}

This supports the confirmability and dependability criteria described by
Lincoln and Guba, allowing others to trace the logic of your analytical
decisions and verify the consistency of your coding process.

When a single object is provided, only its immediate information is shown.
To see the full chain, provide all ancestor objects.

For branching workflows (e.g., when multiple coded objects are compared),
the trail captures all input runs as parents of the comparison.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Code movie reviews with sentiment codebook
coded1 <- qlm_code(
  data_corpus_LMRDsample,
  data_codebook_sentiment,
  model = "openai/gpt-4o",
  name = "gpt4o_run"
)

# Replicate with different model
coded2 <- qlm_replicate(coded1, model = "openai/gpt-4o-mini", name = "mini_run")

# Extract and view the audit trail
trail <- qlm_trail(coded1, coded2)
print(trail)

# Use helper functions for saving/exporting
qlm_trail_save(trail, "trail.rds")
qlm_trail_export(trail, "trail.json")
qlm_trail_report(trail, "trail.qmd")

# Or use qlm_archive() for one-call documentation
qlm_archive(coded1, coded2, path = "workflow")
}
