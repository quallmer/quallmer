\title{Extract provenance trail from quallmer objects}
\usage{
qlm_trail(..., include_data = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more quallmer objects (\code{qlm_coded}, \code{qlm_comparison}, or
\code{qlm_validation}). When multiple objects are provided, they will be used
to reconstruct the complete provenance chain.}

\item{include_data}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, stores the actual coded data alongside
the metadata. This allows you to archive complete results with
\code{qlm_trail_save()}. Default is \code{FALSE} to keep trail objects lightweight.}
}
\value{
A \code{qlm_trail} object containing:
\describe{
\item{runs}{List of run information, ordered from oldest to newest}
\item{complete}{Logical indicating whether all parent references were resolved}
}
}
\description{
Extracts and displays the provenance chain from one or more \code{qlm_coded},
\code{qlm_comparison}, or \code{qlm_validation} objects. When multiple objects are
provided, attempts to reconstruct the full lineage by matching parent-child
relationships.
}
\details{
The provenance trail shows the history of coding runs, including:
\itemize{
\item Run name and parent relationship
\item Model and parameters used
\item Timestamp
\item Call that created the run
}

When a single object is provided, only its immediate lineage (name, parent,
timestamp) is shown. To see the full chain, provide all ancestor objects.

For branching workflows (e.g., when multiple coded objects are compared),
the trail captures all input runs as parents of the comparison.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Single run shows immediate info
coded1 <- qlm_code(reviews, codebook, model = "openai/gpt-4o")
qlm_trail(coded1)

# Create replication chain
coded2 <- qlm_replicate(coded1, model = "openai/gpt-4o-mini")
coded3 <- qlm_replicate(coded2, temperature = 0.7)

# Reconstruct full chain
trail <- qlm_trail(coded3, coded2, coded1)
print(trail)

# Include actual coded data for complete archival
trail_with_data <- qlm_trail(coded3, coded2, coded1, include_data = TRUE)
qlm_trail_save(trail_with_data, "analysis_trail_complete.rds")

# Export metadata only as JSON
qlm_trail_export(trail, "analysis_trail.json")
}
