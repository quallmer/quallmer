\title{Compute agreement across Trail settings}
\usage{
trail_agreement(
  x,
  id_col = "id",
  label_col = "label",
  min_coders = 2L,
  agreement_fun = agreement
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{trail_compare} object or a list of \code{trail_record}
objects.}

\item{id_col}{Character scalar. Name of the unit identifier column in
the resulting wide data (defaults to "id").}

\item{label_col}{Character scalar. Name of the label column in each
record's annotations (defaults to "label").}

\item{min_coders}{Integer. Minimum number of non-missing coders per
unit required for inclusion. Passed through to \code{agreement_fun}.}

\item{agreement_fun}{Function used to compute agreement. Defaults to
\code{agreement()}, which is expected to accept \code{data},
\code{unit_id_col}, \code{coder_cols}, and \code{min_coders}.}
}
\value{
The result of calling \code{agreement_fun()} on the wide data,
  typically a data frame of agreement statistics.
}
\description{
Convenience helper to compute intercoder reliability across multiple
Trail records or a Trail comparison by treating each setting as a
coder.
