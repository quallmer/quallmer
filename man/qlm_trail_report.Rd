}
\arguments{
\item{trail}{A \code{qlm_trail} object from \code{\link[=qlm_trail]{qlm_trail()}}.}

\item{file}{Path to save the report file (\code{.qmd} or \code{.Rmd}).}

\item{analyses}{Optional. A \code{qlm_trail_analyses} object from \code{\link[=qlm_trail_analyses]{qlm_trail_analyses()}}
containing comparison and validation metrics to include in the report.}

\item{robustness}{Optional. A \code{qlm_robustness} object from \code{\link[=qlm_trail_robustness]{qlm_trail_robustness()}}
containing downstream analysis robustness metrics to include in the report.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the file path.
}
\description{
Generates a human-readable Quarto/RMarkdown document summarizing the
provenance trail, optionally including assessment metrics across runs.
}
\details{
Creates a formatted document showing:
\itemize{
\item Trail summary and completeness
\item Timeline of runs
\item Model parameters and settings for each run
\item Parent-child relationships
\item Assessment metrics (if provided):
\itemize{
\item Inter-rater reliability comparisons
\item Validation results against gold standards
\item Downstream analysis robustness
}
}

The generated file can be rendered to HTML, PDF, or other formats using
Quarto or RMarkdown.
