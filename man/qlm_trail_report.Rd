\arguments{
\item{trail}{A \code{qlm_trail} object from \code{\link[=qlm_trail]{qlm_trail()}}.}

\item{file}{Path to save the report file (\code{.qmd} or \code{.Rmd}).}

\item{include_comparisons}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, include comparison metrics
in the report (if any comparisons are in the trail). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{include_validations}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, include validation metrics
in the report (if any validations are in the trail). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{robustness}{Optional. A \code{qlm_robustness} object from \code{\link[=qlm_trail_robustness]{qlm_trail_robustness()}}
containing downstream analysis robustness metrics to include in the report.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the file path.

\description{
Generates a human-readable Quarto/RMarkdown document summarizing the
provenance trail, optionally including assessment metrics across runs.
}
\details{
Creates a formatted document showing:
\itemize{
\item Trail summary and completeness
\item Timeline of runs
\item Model parameters and settings for each run
\item Parent-child relationships
\item Assessment metrics (if requested):
\itemize{
\item Inter-rater reliability comparisons
\item Validation results against gold standards
\item Downstream analysis robustness
}
}

The generated file can be rendered to HTML, PDF, or other formats using
Quarto or RMarkdown.
