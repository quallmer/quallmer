\title{Convert Trail records to coder-style wide data}
\usage{
trail_matrix(x, id_col = "id", label_col = "label")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a \code{trail_compare} object or a named list of
\code{trail_record} objects.}

\item{id_col}{Character scalar. Name of the column that identifies
units (documents, paragraphs, etc.). Must be present in each
record's \code{annotations} data.}

\item{label_col}{Character scalar. Name of the column in each
record's \code{annotations} data containing the code or label of
interest.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per unit and one column per
setting/record. The unit ID column is retained under the name
\code{id_col}.
}
\description{
Treat each setting/record in a \code{trail_compare} object as a separate
coder and convert the annotations into a wide data frame suitable for
inter-rater reliability analysis or other comparisons.
