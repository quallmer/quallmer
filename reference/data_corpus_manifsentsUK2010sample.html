    <p>The corpus consists of 155 sentences randomly sampled from the party manifestos, with an attempt to balance
  the sentencs according to their categorisation as pertaining to immigration or not, as well as by party.
  The corpus contains the following document-level variables:</p><dl><dt>party</dt>
<dd><p>factor; abbreviation of the party that wrote the manifesto.</p></dd>

  <dt>partyname</dt>
<dd><p>factor; party that wrote the manifesto.</p></dd>

  <dt>year</dt>
<dd><p>integer; 4-digit year of the election.</p></dd>

  <dt>crowd_immigration_label</dt>
<dd><p>Factor indicating whether the majority of
  crowd workers labelled a sentence as referring to immigration or not. The
  variable has missing values (`NA`) for all non-annotated manifestos.</p></dd>

  <dt>crowd_immigration_mean</dt>
<dd><p>numeric; the direction
  of statements coded as "Immigration" based on the aggregated crowd codings.
  The variable is the mean of the scores assigned by workers who coded a
  sentence and who allocated the sentence to the "Immigration" category. The
  variable ranges from -1 (Favorable and open immigration policy) to +1
  ("Negative and closed immigration policy").</p></dd>

  <dt>crowd_immigration_n</dt>
<dd><p>integer; the number of coders who
  contributed to the
  mean score `crowd_immigration_mean`.</p></dd>
