# quallmer: Qualitative Analysis with Large Language Models

Tools for AI-assisted qualitative data annotation using large language
models (LLMs). Provides predefined tasks for sentiment analysis, stance
detection, ideological scaling, topic salience, and fact-checking, as
well as custom task definitions. Includes functions for computing
intercoder reliability and gold-standard validation metrics,
reproducible annotation trails across multiple LLM configurations, and
an interactive 'shiny' application for manual coding and LLM output
validation.
