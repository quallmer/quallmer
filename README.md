The `quallmer` package is an **easy-to-use toolbox for qualitative
researchers to quickly apply AI-assisted annotation to texts, images,
pdfs, tabular data and other structured data.**

Using `annotate()`, users can generate structured, interpretable outputs
powered by large language models (LLMs). The package includes a library
of [predefined tasks for common qualitative coding
needs](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/overview.html),
such as sentiment analysis, thematic coding, and stance detection. It
also allows users to [create their own custom annotation tasks tailored
to their specific research questions and data
types](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/tutorials/customtask.html)
using `define_task()`. To ensure quality and reliability of AI-generated
annotations, `quallmer` offers tools for comparing LLM outputs with
human-coded data and assessing inter-coder reliability. With
`agreement()`, users can launch an interactive app to manually code
data, review AI annotations, and evaluate intercoder reliability between
coders and agreement with LLM-generated scores.

**The `quallmer` package makes AI-assisted qualitative coding accessible
without requiring deep expertise in R, programming or machine
learning.**

# Included functions

The package provides the following core functions:

### `annotate()`

- A generic function that works with any LLM supported by
  [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/index.html).  
- Generates structured responses based on
  [predefined](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/overview.htmll)
  or [user-defined
  tasks](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/tutorials/customtask.html).

### `define_task()`

- Creates custom annotation tasks tailored to specific research
  questions and data types.
- Uses `system_prompt` and `type_object()` from the
  [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/articles/structured-data.html)
  package to define how the LLM should interpret inputs and format
  outputs.  
- Tasks created with `define_task()` can be passed directly to
  `annotate()`.  
- This allows users to tailor the annotation process to their specific
  data types and makes our package extensible for future use cases.

### `agreement()`

- Launches an interactive app to manually code data and review
  LLM-generated annotations.  
- Compares AI annotations with human-coded data to evaluate agreement
  and inter-coder reliability.

# Supported LLMs

The package supports all LLMs currently available with the `ellmer`
package. For authentication and usage of each of these LLMs, please
refer to the respective
[ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)
documentation and see our [tutorial for setting up an openai API
key](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/tutorials/openai.html)
or [getting started with an open-source Ollama
model](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/tutorials/ollama.html).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `quallmer` from
<https://github.com/SeraphineM/quallmer> with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SeraphineM/quallmer")
```

## Example use and tutorials

To learn more about how to use the package, please refer to our
[step-by-step
tutorials](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/getting-started.html)
and the illustrations on [how to use the predefined
tasks](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/overview.html).
