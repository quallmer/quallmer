# Example: Ideology detection

The
[`annotate()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/annotate.md)
function with a predefined
[`task_ideology()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_ideology.md)
allows you to perform ideological scaling (0-10) on texts regarding a
specified ideological dimension. In this example, we will demonstrate
how to use the
[`task_ideology()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_ideology.md)
for ideology detection on a sample corpus of innaugural speeches from
U.S. presidents. We will use the dimension “inclusive–exclusive” as an
example. To refine the task, we will also provide a definition of the
dimension (optional).

### Loading packages and data

``` r
# We will use the quanteda package 
# for loading a sample corpus of innaugural speeches
# If you have not yet installed the quanteda package, you can do so by:
# install.packages("quanteda")
library(quanteda)
```

    ## Package version: 4.3.1
    ## Unicode version: 15.1
    ## ICU version: 74.2

    ## Parallel computing: disabled

    ## See https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.

``` r
library(quallmer)
```

    ## Loading required package: ellmer

``` r
# For educational purposes, 
# we will use a subset of the inaugural speeches corpus
# The three most recent speeches in the corpus
data_corpus_inaugural <- quanteda::data_corpus_inaugural[57:60]
```

### Using `annotate()` for ideological scaling of texts

``` r
# Define ideological dimension
dimension <- "inclusive–exclusive"
# Provide definition for the dimension
definition <- "Inclusive language emphasizes equal rights, diversity, pluralism, 
and protection of minorities, whereas exclusive language emphasizes exclusion 
of groups, national homogeneity, and restricting rights."
# Apply predefined ideology task with task_ideology() in the annotate() function
result <- annotate(data_corpus_inaugural, task = task_ideology(dimension, definition), 
                   chat_fn = chat_openai, model = "gpt-4o",
                   api_args = list(temperature = 0))
```

|:-----------|------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2013-Obama |     0 | The text emphasizes inclusivity through repeated references to equality, diversity, and collective action. It highlights the importance of equal rights for all citizens, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation, and stresses the need for unity and shared responsibility. Phrases like ‘all men are created equal,’ ‘diversity and openness,’ and ‘our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law’ underscore an inclusive ideology. |
| 2017-Trump |     7 | The text emphasizes national homogeneity and prioritizes American interests with phrases like “America first” and “buy American and hire American.” It highlights protectionism and a focus on American workers and families, suggesting an exclusive stance. However, it also includes some inclusive elements, such as unity and equality among Americans, regardless of race, which slightly moderates the exclusivity.                                                                                    |
| 2021-Biden |     0 | The text emphasizes unity, inclusion, and addressing systemic issues like racial justice and political extremism. It calls for treating each other with dignity and respect, and highlights the importance of diversity and pluralism. These elements strongly align with the inclusive pole of the dimension.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2025-Trump |     8 | The text emphasizes national sovereignty, exclusion of ‘criminal aliens,’ and a focus on American exceptionalism, which aligns with exclusive language. Phrases like ‘put America first,’ ‘halt illegal entry,’ and ‘returning millions of criminal aliens’ highlight exclusionary policies. The mention of ‘only two genders’ and ending ‘socially engineered race and gender’ policies further supports an exclusive stance.                                                                                |

### Adjusting the ideology scaling task

You can customize the ideological scaling task by defining your own task
with [`task()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/task.md)
(for a more detailed explanation, [see our “Defining custom tasks”
tutorial](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/tutorials/customtask.html)).
For example, you might like to change the scale from 0-10 to -5 to +5.

``` r
custom_ideology <- task(
    name = "Ideological scaling",
    system_prompt = paste0(
      "You are an expert political scientist performing ideological text scaling.",
      "Task:",
      "- Read each short text carefully.",
      "- Place the text on a -5 to +5 scale for the following ideological dimension: ",
      dimension, 
      definition
    ),
    type_def = ellmer::type_object(
      score       = ellmer::type_integer("Ideological position on the specified dimension (0–10, where -5 = first pole, +5 = second pole)"),
      explanation = ellmer::type_string("Brief justification for the assigned score, referring to specific elements in the text")
    ),
    input_type = "text"
  )
# Apply the custom task
custom_result <- annotate(data_corpus_inaugural, task = custom_ideology, 
                          chat_fn = chat_openai, model = "gpt-4o",
                          api_args = list(temperature = 0))
```

| 2013-Obama |     5 | The text strongly emphasizes inclusivity, highlighting themes of equality, diversity, and collective action. It advocates for equal rights across gender, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status, and stresses the importance of welcoming immigrants and supporting marginalized groups. The language consistently promotes pluralism and the protection of minorities, aligning with an inclusive ideological stance.                   |
| 2017-Trump |    -2 | The text emphasizes national homogeneity and prioritizes American interests with phrases like “America first” and “protect our borders.” It highlights exclusionary themes by focusing on protecting American jobs and industries from foreign influence. However, it also includes some inclusive elements, such as unity among Americans regardless of race, which moderates the exclusivity slightly.                                        |
| 2021-Biden |     5 | The text emphasizes unity, inclusion, and the protection of democracy, highlighting themes of racial justice, equality, and the rejection of division. It calls for collective action and respect for all Americans, regardless of differences, aligning strongly with inclusive language.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2025-Trump |    -3 | The text emphasizes national sovereignty, border control, and exclusionary policies such as halting illegal entry and returning ‘criminal aliens.’ It also mentions ending government policies on race and gender, suggesting a move towards a more exclusive, homogeneous national identity. While there are mentions of unity and inclusion of various American communities, the overall tone and specific policies lean towards exclusivity. |

In this example, we demonstrated how to use the
[`task_ideology()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_ideology.md)
for scaling texts regarding their ideological position on a specified
dimension. We also showed how to customize the task using the
[`task()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/task.md)
function for more tailored annotation needs, e.g., changing the scale
from 0-10 to -5 to +5. Now you can apply these techniques to your own
text data for ideological analysis!
