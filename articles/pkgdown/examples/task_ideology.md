# Example: Ideology detection

The
[`annotate()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/annotate.md)
function with a predefined
[`task_ideology()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_ideology.md)
allows you to perform ideological scaling (0-10) on texts regarding a
specified ideological dimension. In this example, we will demonstrate
how to use the
[`task_ideology()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_ideology.md)
for ideology detection on a sample corpus of innaugural speeches from
U.S. presidents. We will use the dimension “inclusive–exclusive” as an
example. To refine the task, we will also provide a definition of the
dimension (optional).

| id | score | explanation |
|:---|---:|:---|
| 2013-Obama | 1 | The text emphasizes inclusivity, highlighting themes of equality, diversity, and collective action. It references historical struggles for civil rights and equality, and calls for unity across differences. Phrases like ‘all men are created equal,’ ‘diversity and openness,’ and ‘our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law’ strongly support an inclusive ideology. |
| 2017-Trump | 7 | The text emphasizes national homogeneity and prioritizes American interests with phrases like “America first” and “buy American and hire American.” It highlights protectionism and a focus on American workers and borders, suggesting an exclusive stance. However, it also includes some inclusive elements, such as unity and equality among Americans, regardless of race, which slightly moderates the exclusivity. |
| 2021-Biden | 0 | The text emphasizes unity, inclusion, and addressing systemic issues like racial justice and political extremism. It calls for seeing each other as neighbors, treating each other with dignity, and uniting against common challenges. These elements strongly align with inclusive language. |
| 2025-Trump | 8 | The text emphasizes national sovereignty, exclusion of ‘criminal aliens,’ and a focus on American exceptionalism, which aligns with exclusive language. Phrases like ‘put America first,’ ‘reclaim our sovereignty,’ and ‘halt illegal entry’ suggest a restrictive stance on immigration and national identity. The mention of ‘only two genders’ and ending ‘socially engineered race and gender’ policies further indicates exclusivity. |

### Adjusting the ideology scaling task

You can customize the ideological scaling task by defining your own task
with [`task()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/task.md)
(for a more detailed explanation, [see our “Defining custom tasks”
tutorial](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/tutorials/customtask.html)).
For example, you might like to change the scale from 0-10 to -5 to +5.

`custom_ideology`` ``<-`` `[`task`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/task.md)`(`` `` name ``=`` ``"Ideological scaling"``,`` `` system_prompt ``=`` `[`paste0`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/paste.html)`(`` `` ``"You are an expert political scientist performing ideological text scaling."``,`` `` ``"Task:"``,`` `` ``"- Read each short text carefully."``,`` `` ``"- Place the text on a -5 to +5 scale for the following ideological dimension: "``,`` `` ``dimension``, `` `` ``definition`` `` ``)``,`` `` type_def ``=`` ``ellmer``::`[`type_object`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html)`(`` `` score ``=`` ``ellmer``::`[`type_integer`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html)`(``"Ideological position on the specified dimension (0–10, where -5 = first pole, +5 = second pole)"``)``,`` `` explanation ``=`` ``ellmer``::`[`type_string`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html)`(``"Brief justification for the assigned score, referring to specific elements in the text"``)`` `` ``)``,`` `` input_type ``=`` ``"text"`` `` ``)`` ``# Apply the custom task`` ``custom_result`` ``<-`` `[`annotate`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/annotate.md)`(``data_corpus_inaugural``, task ``=`` ``custom_ideology``,`` `` model_name ``=`` ``"openai/gpt-4o"``,`` `` params ``=`` `[`list`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)`(``temperature ``=`` ``0``)``)`

| 2013-Obama | 5 | The text strongly emphasizes inclusivity, highlighting themes of equality, diversity, and collective action. It references historical struggles for civil rights and equality, and advocates for the protection and empowerment of marginalized groups, such as immigrants, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. The language consistently supports pluralism and the idea that America’s strength lies in its diversity and commitment to equal rights for all citizens. |
| 2017-Trump | -2 | The text emphasizes national homogeneity and prioritizes American interests with phrases like “America first” and “protect our borders.” It also highlights exclusionary economic policies such as “buy American and hire American.” While there are inclusive elements, such as unity and shared national identity, the overall tone leans towards exclusivity. |
| 2021-Biden | 5 | The text emphasizes unity, inclusion, and the protection of democracy, highlighting the importance of diversity, racial justice, and overcoming division. It calls for collective action and respect for all Americans, regardless of differences, and explicitly rejects exclusionary ideologies like white supremacy. The language is inclusive, focusing on healing, unity, and equal rights. |
| 2025-Trump | -3 | The speech emphasizes national sovereignty, protection of borders, and exclusionary policies such as halting illegal entry and returning ‘criminal aliens.’ It also includes language about national pride and reclaiming American greatness, which aligns with exclusive rhetoric. However, there are mentions of unity and support for diverse communities, which slightly moderates the exclusivity. |

In this example, we demonstrated how to use the
[`task_ideology()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_ideology.md)
for scaling texts regarding their ideological position on a specified
dimension. We also showed how to customize the task using the
[`task()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/task.md)
function for more tailored annotation needs, e.g., changing the scale
from 0-10 to -5 to +5. Now you can apply these techniques to your own
text data for ideological analysis!
