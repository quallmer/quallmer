# Example: Salience of topics

The
[`annotate()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/annotate.md)
function with a predefined
[`task_salience()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_salience.md)
can be used to identify and rank the salience of topics discussed in
texts. In this example, we will demonstrate how to apply this task to a
sample corpus of innaugural speeches from US presidents.

### Loading packages and data

``` r
# We will use the quanteda package 
# for loading a sample corpus of innaugural speeches
# If you have not yet installed the quanteda package, you can do so by:
# install.packages("quanteda")
library(quanteda)
```

    ## Package version: 4.3.1
    ## Unicode version: 15.1
    ## ICU version: 74.2

    ## Parallel computing: disabled

    ## See https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.

``` r
library(quallmer)
```

    ## Loading required package: ellmer

``` r
# For educational purposes, 
# we will use a subset of the inaugural speeches corpus
# The three most recent speeches in the corpus
data_corpus_inaugural <- quanteda::data_corpus_inaugural[57:60]
```

### Using `annotate()` for salience of ANY topics discussed in texts

``` r
# Apply predefined salience task with task_salience() in the annotate() function
result <- annotate(data_corpus_inaugural, task = task_salience(), 
                   chat_fn = chat_openai, model = "gpt-4o",
                   api_args = list(temperature = 0))
```

    ## Running task 'Salience (ranked topics)' using model: gpt-4o

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 3 -> 1 | ■■■■■■■■■                         25%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 2 -> 2 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■                  50%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 0 -> 4 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■  100%

[TABLE]

### Using `annotate()` for salience of a SPECIFIED LIST of topics discussed in texts

``` r
# Define a list of topics to focus on
topics <- c("economy", "health", "education", "environment", "foreign policy")
# Apply predefined salience task with task_salience() in the annotate() function
result <- annotate(data_corpus_inaugural, task = task_salience(topics), 
                   chat_fn = chat_openai, model = "gpt-4o",
                   api_args = list(temperature = 0))
```

    ## Running task 'Salience (ranked topics)' using model: gpt-4o

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 3 -> 1 | ■■■■■■■■■                         25%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 2 -> 2 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■                  50%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 0 -> 4 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■  100%

### Adjusting the task_salience() so it also returns the stance for each topic

``` r
# Customizing the task to include the stance for each topic
custom_task <- task(
  name = "Salience and stance of topics",
  system_prompt = paste(
    "You are an expert analysing the content of texts.",
    "",
    "Task:",
    "- Read the text carefully.",
    "- Identify and rank the salience of the following topics: economy, health, education, environment, foreign policy.",
    "- For each topic mentioned, assign a stance as one of the following:",
    "  pro, neutral, or contra.",
    "- Append the stance directly after each topic name in the form 'topic: stance'.",
    "- Return all topic:stance entries in descending order of salience.",
    "- Separate entries with commas when presenting them in a list.",
    "",
    "Do not infer information that is not in the text.",
    "Base all evaluations solely on the language and arguments in the document.",
    "",
    "Output:",
    "- `topic_stance`: a ranked list of topic labels with stance labels appended (e.g., 'economy: pro', 'health: contra').",
    "- `explanation`: a brief justification explaining why the topics were ordered and how stance was determined.",
    sep = "\n"
  ),
  type_def = ellmer::type_object(
    topic_stance = ellmer::type_array(
      ellmer::type_string("Topic and stance label combined (e.g., 'economy: pro'), ranked by salience.")
    ),
    explanation = ellmer::type_string(
      "Brief justification for the salience ordering and stance classification."
    )
  ),
  input_type = "text"
)

# Apply the customized task in the annotate() function
custom_result <- annotate(data_corpus_inaugural, task = custom_task, 
                   chat_fn = chat_openai, model = "gpt-4o",
                   api_args = list(temperature = 0))

In this example, we demonstrated how to use the
[`task_salience()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_salience.md)
for identifying and ranking topics discussed in texts, both with and
without a predefined list of topics. Additionally, we showed how to
customize the task to include stance classification for each topic. This
showcases the flexibility of the
[`annotate()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/annotate.md)
function and the `task` framework in `quallmer` for various text
analysis tasks.
