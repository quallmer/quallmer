# Example: Salience of topics

The
[`annotate()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/annotate.md)
function with a predefined
[`task_salience()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_salience.md)
can be used to identify and rank the salience of topics discussed in
texts. In this example, we will demonstrate how to apply this task to a
sample corpus of innaugural speeches from US presidents.

### Loading packages and data

`# We will use the quanteda package `` ``# for loading a sample corpus of innaugural speeches`` ``# If you have not yet installed the quanteda package, you can do so by:`` ``# install.packages("quanteda")`` `[`library`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)`(`[`quanteda`](https://quanteda.io)`)`

    ## Package version: 4.3.1

### Using `annotate()` for salience of ANY topics discussed in texts

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 3 -> 1 | ■■■■■■■■■                         25%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 2 -> 2 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■                  50%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 0 -> 4 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■  100%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 3 -> 1 | ■■■■■■■■■                         25%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 1 -> 3 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■           75%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 0 -> 4 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■  100%

| id | topic_stance | explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 2013-Obama | economy: pro , environment: pro , foreign policy: pro, health: pro , education: pro | The text emphasizes the importance of a strong economy, highlighting the need for infrastructure, fair competition, and a rising middle class, indicating a pro stance on the economy. The environment is addressed with a commitment to tackling climate change and leading in sustainable energy, showing a pro stance. Foreign policy is discussed in terms of maintaining alliances and promoting peace, indicating a pro stance. Health is mentioned in the context of reducing healthcare costs and supporting social safety nets, suggesting a pro stance. Education is noted as essential for future success, with a focus on reforming schools and training workers, indicating a pro stance. |
| 2017-Trump | economy: pro , foreign policy: neutral, education: contra , environment: neutral , health: neutral | The text emphasizes economic issues, focusing on job creation, rebuilding infrastructure, and prioritizing American workers, indicating a pro stance on the economy. Foreign policy is addressed with a focus on ‘America first’ and alliances, suggesting a neutral stance as it balances protectionism with international cooperation. Education is mentioned negatively, highlighting a failing system, which suggests a contra stance. The environment is not directly addressed, but infrastructure plans imply a neutral stance. Health is mentioned in the context of eradicating disease, but not in detail, leading to a neutral stance. |
| 2021-Biden | democracy: pro , unity: pro , health: pro , foreign policy: pro, economy: pro , environment: pro | The speech primarily focuses on the theme of democracy, emphasizing its triumph and fragility, making ‘democracy: pro’ the most salient topic. Unity is a central theme, repeatedly mentioned as essential for overcoming challenges, hence ‘unity: pro’ is next. Health is addressed through the context of the pandemic, highlighting its impact and the need for a unified response, leading to ‘health: pro’. Foreign policy is discussed in terms of repairing alliances and engaging globally, resulting in ‘foreign policy: pro’. The economy is mentioned in relation to job losses and rebuilding, thus ‘economy: pro’. The environment is touched upon with a call to address climate crises, making ‘environment: pro’ relevant but less emphasized. |
| 2025-Trump | foreign policy: pro, economy: pro , environment: contra, health: contra , education: contra | The text emphasizes foreign policy with a strong stance on border security, military strength, and international respect, making it the most salient topic with a pro stance. The economy is also prominent, focusing on energy independence, manufacturing, and tariffs, indicating a pro stance. The environment is addressed negatively with the rejection of the Green New Deal, showing a contra stance. Health is mentioned in the context of a failing public health system and COVID vaccine mandates, suggesting a contra stance. Education is criticized for teaching negative views of the country, indicating a contra stance. |

In this example, we demonstrated how to use the
[`task_salience()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/task_salience.md)
for identifying and ranking topics discussed in texts, both with and
without a predefined list of topics. Additionally, we showed how to
customize the task to include stance classification for each topic. This
showcases the flexibility of the
[`annotate()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/annotate.md)
function and the `task` framework in `quallmer` for various text
analysis tasks.
