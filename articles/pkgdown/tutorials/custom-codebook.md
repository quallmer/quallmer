# Creating codebooks

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create custom codebooks for
qualitative coding tasks using the `quallmer` package. Codebooks are
essential for guiding large language models (LLMs) in generating
structured and meaningful outputs based on your research questions.

We’ll demonstrate two approaches:

1.  **Learning from built-in examples**: Inspect the built-in example
    `data_codebook_sentiment` to understand codebook structure

2.  **Creating custom codebooks**: Build a domain-specific codebook for
    political ideology scoring

The built-in codebooks serve as educational templates showing basic
principles of instruction writing, schema design, and role definition.
For actual research, you can create more detailed custom codebooks using
[`qlm_codebook()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_codebook.md)
that match your specific needs.

### Loading packages and data

``` r
# We will use the quanteda package 
# for loading a sample corpus of innaugural speeches
# If you have not yet installed the quanteda package, you can do so by:
# install.packages("quanteda")
library(quanteda)
```

    ## Package version: 4.3.1
    ## Unicode version: 15.1
    ## ICU version: 74.2

    ## Parallel computing: disabled

    ## See https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.

``` r
library(quallmer)
```

    ## Loading required package: ellmer

``` r
# For educational purposes, 
# we will use a subset of the inaugural speeches corpus
# The ten most recent speeches in the corpus
data_corpus_inaugural <- quanteda::data_corpus_inaugural[50:60]
```

### Learning from built-in codebooks examples

Before creating a custom codebook, let’s inspect the built-in
`data_codebook_sentiment` to understand the structure:

``` r
# View the codebook
data_codebook_sentiment
```

    ## quallmer codebook: Sentiment analysis 
    ##   Input type:   text
    ##   Role:         You are a political communication analyst evaluating public ...
    ##   Instructions: Analyze the sentiment of this text, on both a 1-10 scale and...
    ##   Output schema:ellmer::TypeObject

``` r
# Inspect the role
data_codebook_sentiment$role
```

    ## [1] "You are a political communication analyst evaluating public statements."

``` r
# Inspect the instructions
data_codebook_sentiment$instructions
```

    ## [1] "Analyze the sentiment of this text, on both a 1-10 scale and as a polarity of negative or positive."

This shows us:

- The input type is text
- The role defines the model as a political communication analyst
- The instructions guide the model to analyze sentiment on a 1-10 scale
  and classify polarity
- The schema specifies the expected output structure with fields for
  polarity and rating

Now let’s create a custom codebook for our specific research question.

### Defining custom instructions

Defining instructions is a crucial step in creating custom codebooks.
The instructions guide the LLM on how to interpret the input data and
what kind of output to generate. In this example, we will create
instructions that tell the LLM to score documents based on their
alignment with political left ideologies. Instructions can be much
longer and more complex depending on the task at hand. Instructions
should be clear and specific to ensure that the LLM understands the task
requirements.

``` r
instructions <- "Score the following document on a scale of how much it aligns
with the political left. The political left is defined as groups which
advocate for social equality, government intervention in the economy,
and progressive policies. Use the following metrics:
SCORING METRIC:
3 : extremely left
2 : very left
1 : slightly left
0 : not at all left"
```

### Defining the codebook with qlm_codebook()

The
[`qlm_codebook()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_codebook.md)
function allows us to specify the expected structure of the LLM’s
response. It has the following important arguments which users need to
specify:

- `name`: A descriptive name for the codebook.
- `instructions`: The instructions that guide the LLM on how to perform
  the coding task.
- `schema`: Defines the expected structure of the response using
  [ellmer’s type
  specifications](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html)
  such as
  [`type_object()`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html),
  [`type_array()`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html),
  etc.
- `role`: (Optional) A role description for the model (e.g., “You are an
  expert political scientist”).
- `input_type`: The type of input data (`"text"` or `"image"`).

For more information on how to use ellmer’s type specifications, please
refer to the [ellmer documentation on type
specifications](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html).

``` r
# Define the custom codebook using qlm_codebook()
ideology_codebook <- qlm_codebook(
  name = "Score Political Left Alignment",
  instructions = instructions,
  schema = type_object(
    score = type_number("Score"),
    explanation = type_string("Explanation")
  ),
  role = "You are an expert political scientist analyzing political texts.",
  input_type = "text"
)
```

### Applying the custom codebook to the corpus

We use the
[`qlm_code()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_code.md)
function to apply our custom codebook to the sample corpus of inaugural
speeches. We specify the model to use via `model` (in this case,
`"openai/gpt-4o"`) and any additional parameters as needed. For example,
we set the temperature to 0 for more deterministic outputs, improving
consistency in scoring across multiple runs and therefore increasing
reliability.

The
[`qlm_code()`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_code.md)
function returns a `qlm_coded` object, which is a tibble containing the
coded results along with metadata stored as attributes. The object
prints as a tibble and can be used directly in data manipulation
workflows.

``` r
# Apply the custom codebook to the inaugural speeches corpus
coded <- qlm_code(data_corpus_inaugural,
                  codebook = ideology_codebook,
                  model = "openai/gpt-4o",
                  params = params(temperature = 0))
```

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 10 -> 1 | ■■■■                               9%

    ## [working] (0 + 0) -> 0 -> 11 | ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■  100%

``` r
# View the results
coded
```

    ## # quallmer coded object

|:-------------|------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1985-Reagan  |     0 | The document emphasizes reducing government intervention, lowering taxes, and promoting free enterprise, which align with conservative principles rather than the political left. It advocates for limiting the size and spending of the federal government, which contrasts with the left’s support for government intervention in the economy. The focus on individual freedom, reducing dependency, and a strong national defense further aligns with right-leaning ideologies.                                                       |
| 1989-Bush    |     0 | The document emphasizes themes such as free markets, limited government intervention, and individual responsibility, which align more with conservative or right-leaning ideologies. It critiques reliance on public money to solve social issues and promotes private initiative and community involvement. These elements do not align with the political left’s focus on government intervention and social equality.                                                                                                                 |
| 1993-Clinton |     1 | The document contains elements that align slightly with the political left, such as advocating for investment in people, addressing economic inequality, and reforming politics to reduce the influence of power and privilege. However, it also emphasizes personal responsibility, competition, and a strong national defense, which are not typically left-leaning priorities. The overall tone is more centrist, with a focus on unity and renewal rather than explicitly progressive policies.                                      |
| 1997-Clinton |     1 | The document contains elements that align slightly with the political left, such as advocating for civil rights, social equality, and educational opportunities for all. However, it also emphasizes personal responsibility, a smaller government, and free enterprise, which are not typically associated with the political left. The focus on balancing the budget and reducing government intervention further suggests a centrist or slightly left position rather than a strong alignment with the political left.                |
| 2001-Bush    |     1 | The document contains elements that align slightly with the political left, such as advocating for social justice, addressing poverty, and emphasizing public education and civil rights. However, it also includes themes of personal responsibility, tax reduction, and strong national defense, which are more centrist or right-leaning. The overall tone is one of unity and shared values, rather than a strong push for progressive policies or government intervention in the economy.                                           |
| 2005-Bush    |     0 | The document emphasizes themes of freedom, democracy, and individual responsibility, which are more aligned with conservative and neoconservative ideologies. It focuses on spreading democracy globally, national security, and individual character, rather than advocating for social equality or government intervention in the economy, which are key aspects of the political left. The mention of an ‘ownership society’ and economic independence further aligns with right-leaning principles.                                  |
| 2009-Obama   |     2 | The document aligns very well with the political left, emphasizing themes of social equality, government intervention, and progressive policies. It advocates for addressing economic inequality, reforming healthcare, investing in infrastructure, and promoting renewable energy. The speech also calls for international cooperation and social responsibility, which are key aspects of leftist ideology. However, it balances these with appeals to traditional values and national unity, which slightly moderates its alignment. |
| 2013-Obama   |     2 | The document aligns very well with the political left, emphasizing social equality, government intervention, and progressive policies. It advocates for collective action, economic equality, environmental responsibility, and social justice, all of which are key tenets of leftist ideology. However, it also acknowledges the importance of personal responsibility and skepticism of central authority, which tempers its alignment slightly.                                                                                      |
| 2017-Trump   |     0 | The document emphasizes nationalism, protectionism, and a focus on “America first,” which are not typically aligned with the political left. It lacks advocacy for social equality, government intervention in the economy, or progressive policies, which are key characteristics of the political left. Instead, it focuses on reducing government power in favor of populist themes and national pride.                                                                                                                               |
| 2021-Biden   |     2 | The document aligns very well with the political left, as it emphasizes themes of social equality, racial justice, and government intervention in addressing economic and health crises. It calls for unity and collective action to overcome challenges such as systemic racism, climate change, and economic inequality. However, it also appeals to broader American values and unity, which tempers its alignment with the extreme left.                                                                                             |
| 2025-Trump   |     0 | The document primarily emphasizes nationalism, sovereignty, and a strong military, which are not typically aligned with the political left. It advocates for policies like border control, energy independence through fossil fuels, and a reduction in government intervention in social issues, which are more characteristic of right-wing ideologies. There is little emphasis on social equality or progressive economic policies, which are central to the political left.                                                         |
