# Creating codebooks

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create custom codebooks for
qualitative coding tasks using the `quallmer` package. Codebooks are
essential for guiding large language models (LLMs) in generating
structured and meaningful outputs based on your research questions.

We’ll demonstrate two approaches:

1.  **Learning from built-in examples**: Inspect the built-in example
    `data_codebook_sentiment` to understand codebook structure

2.  **Creating custom codebooks**: Build a domain-specific codebook for
    political ideology scoring

The built-in codebooks serve as educational templates showing basic
principles of instruction writing, schema design, and role definition.
For actual research, you can create more detailed custom codebooks using
[`qlm_codebook()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_codebook.md)
that match your specific needs.

### Loading packages and data

`# We will use the quanteda package `` ``# for loading a sample corpus of innaugural speeches`` ``# If you have not yet installed the quanteda package, you can do so by:`` ``# install.packages("quanteda")`` `[`library`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)`(`[`quanteda`](https://quanteda.io)`)`

    ## Package version: 4.3.1
    ## Unicode version: 14.0
    ## ICU version: 71.1

    ## Parallel computing: disabled

    ## See https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.

[`library`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)`(`[`quallmer`](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/)`)`

    ## Loading required package: ellmer

`# For educational purposes, `` ``# we will use a subset of the inaugural speeches corpus`` ``# The ten most recent speeches in the corpus`` ``data_corpus_inaugural`` ``<-`` ``quanteda``::`[`data_corpus_inaugural`](https://quanteda.io/reference/data_corpus_inaugural.html)`[``50``:``60``]`

### Learning from built-in codebooks examples

Before creating a custom codebook, let’s inspect the built-in
`data_codebook_sentiment` to understand the structure:

`# View the codebook`` ``data_codebook_sentiment`

    ## quallmer codebook: Sentiment analysis 
    ##   Input type:   text
    ##   Role:         You are a political communication analyst evaluating public ...
    ##   Instructions: Analyze the sentiment of this text, on both a 1-10 scale and...
    ##   Output schema:ellmer::TypeObject

`# Inspect the role`` ``data_codebook_sentiment``$``role`

    ## [1] "You are a political communication analyst evaluating public statements."

`# Inspect the instructions`` ``data_codebook_sentiment``$``instructions`

    ## [1] "Analyze the sentiment of this text, on both a 1-10 scale and as a polarity of negative or positive."

This shows us: - The input type is text - The role defines the model as
a political communication analyst - The instructions guide the model to
analyze sentiment on a 1-10 scale and classify polarity - The schema
specifies the expected output structure with fields for polarity and
rating

Now let’s create a custom codebook for our specific research question.

### Defining custom instructions

Defining instructions is a crucial step in creating custom codebooks.
The instructions guide the LLM on how to interpret the input data and
what kind of output to generate. In this example, we will create
instructions that tell the LLM to score documents based on their
alignment with political left ideologies. Instructions can be much
longer and more complex depending on the task at hand. Instructions
should be clear and specific to ensure that the LLM understands the task
requirements.

`instructions`` ``<-`` ``"Score the following document on a scale of how much it aligns`` ``with the political left. The political left is defined as groups which`` ``advocate for social equality, government intervention in the economy,`` ``and progressive policies. Use the following metrics:`` ``SCORING METRIC:`` ``3 : extremely left`` ``2 : very left`` ``1 : slightly left`` ``0 : not at all left"`

### Defining the codebook with qlm_codebook()

The
[`qlm_codebook()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_codebook.md)
function allows us to specify the expected structure of the LLM’s
response. It has the following important arguments which users need to
specify:

- `name`: A descriptive name for the codebook.
- `instructions`: The instructions that guide the LLM on how to perform
  the coding task.
- `schema`: Defines the expected structure of the response using
  [ellmer’s type
  specifications](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html)
  such as
  [`type_object()`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html),
  [`type_array()`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html),
  etc.
- `role`: (Optional) A role description for the model (e.g., “You are an
  expert political scientist”).
- `input_type`: The type of input data (`"text"` or `"image"`).

For more information on how to use ellmer’s type specifications, please
refer to the [ellmer documentation on type
specifications](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html).

`# Define the custom codebook using qlm_codebook()`` ``ideology_codebook`` ``<-`` `[`qlm_codebook`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_codebook.md)`(`` `` name ``=`` ``"Score Political Left Alignment"``,`` `` instructions ``=`` ``instructions``,`` `` schema ``=`` `[`type_object`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html)`(`` `` score ``=`` `[`type_number`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html)`(``"Score"``)``,`` `` explanation ``=`` `[`type_string`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/type_boolean.html)`(``"Explanation"``)`` `` ``)``,`` `` role ``=`` ``"You are an expert political scientist analyzing political texts."``,`` `` input_type ``=`` ``"text"`` ``)`

### Applying the custom codebook to the corpus

We use the
[`qlm_code()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_code.md)
function to apply our custom codebook to the sample corpus of inaugural
speeches. We specify the model to use via `model` (in this case,
`"openai/gpt-4o"`) and any additional parameters as needed. For example,
we set the temperature to 0 for more deterministic outputs, improving
consistency in scoring across multiple runs and therefore increasing
reliability.

The
[`qlm_code()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_code.md)
function returns a `qlm_coded` object, which is a tibble containing the
coded results along with metadata stored as attributes. The object
prints as a tibble and can be used directly in data manipulation
workflows.

`# Apply the custom codebook to the inaugural speeches corpus`` ``coded`` ``<-`` `[`qlm_code`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_code.md)`(``data_corpus_inaugural``,`` `` codebook ``=`` ``ideology_codebook``,`` `` model ``=`` ``"openai/gpt-4o"``,`` `` params ``=`` `[`params`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/params.html)`(``temperature ``=`` ``0``)``)`

| .id | score | explanation |
|:---|---:|:---|
| 1985-Reagan | 0 | The document emphasizes reducing government intervention, lowering taxes, and promoting free enterprise, which align with conservative principles rather than the political left. It advocates for limiting the size and power of the federal government, which contrasts with the left’s preference for government intervention in the economy and social equality. The focus on individual freedom, reducing dependency, and a strong national defense further aligns with right-leaning ideologies. |
| 1989-Bush | 0 | The document emphasizes themes such as free markets, limited government intervention, and individual responsibility, which align more with conservative or right-leaning ideologies. It critiques reliance on public money to solve social issues and stresses the importance of personal and community involvement. The focus on reducing the deficit and balancing the budget also reflects a fiscally conservative stance. Overall, the speech does not advocate for the progressive policies or government intervention typically associated with the political left. |
| 1993-Clinton | 1 | The document contains elements that align slightly with the political left, such as advocating for investment in people, addressing economic inequality, and reforming politics to reduce the influence of power and privilege. However, it also emphasizes personal responsibility, competition, and a strong national defense, which are not typically associated with leftist ideology. The overall tone is more centrist, with a focus on unity and renewal rather than explicitly progressive policies. |
| 1997-Clinton | 1 | The document contains elements that align slightly with the political left, such as advocating for civil rights, social equality, and educational opportunities for all. However, it also emphasizes personal responsibility, a smaller government, and free enterprise, which are not typically associated with the political left. The balance between these elements suggests a slightly left alignment. |
| 2001-Bush | 0 | The document is an inaugural address that emphasizes unity, personal responsibility, and traditional values. It mentions reducing taxes and building strong defenses, which align more with conservative principles. While it acknowledges social issues like poverty and education, it emphasizes community and individual action over government intervention, which is not characteristic of the political left. |
| 2005-Bush | 0 | The document primarily emphasizes themes of freedom, democracy, and national security, with a focus on promoting liberty globally. It does not advocate for social equality, government intervention in the economy, or progressive policies typically associated with the political left. Instead, it aligns more with conservative values, such as individual responsibility and limited government intervention. |
| 2009-Obama | 2 | The speech aligns very well with the political left due to its emphasis on social equality, government intervention, and progressive policies. It advocates for addressing economic inequality, reforming healthcare, investing in infrastructure, and promoting renewable energy. The call for international cooperation and addressing climate change also reflects left-leaning values. However, it balances these with appeals to traditional American values and bipartisan unity, which slightly moderates its alignment. |
| 2013-Obama | 2 | The document aligns very well with the political left, emphasizing social equality, government intervention, and progressive policies. It advocates for collective action, economic equality, environmental responsibility, and social justice, all of which are key tenets of leftist ideology. However, it also acknowledges the importance of personal responsibility and skepticism of central authority, which slightly moderates its alignment. |
| 2017-Trump | 0 | The document emphasizes nationalism, protectionism, and a focus on “America first” policies, which are not typically aligned with the political left. It lacks advocacy for social equality, government intervention in the economy, or progressive policies, which are key characteristics of the political left. Instead, it focuses on reducing government power in favor of populist rhetoric and national pride. |
| 2021-Biden | 2 | The document aligns very well with the political left, emphasizing themes of social equality, racial justice, and government intervention in addressing economic and health crises. It calls for unity and collective action to tackle systemic racism, climate change, and economic inequality, which are key progressive priorities. However, it also appeals to broader American values and unity, which slightly moderates its alignment with the extreme left. |
| 2025-Trump | 0 | The document emphasizes nationalism, sovereignty, and a strong military, which are typically associated with right-wing ideologies. It criticizes government intervention in areas like education and public health, opposes progressive policies like the Green New Deal, and focuses on border security and energy independence. These positions do not align with the political left’s advocacy for social equality, government intervention in the economy, and progressive policies. |
