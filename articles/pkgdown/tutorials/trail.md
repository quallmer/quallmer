# The quallmer audit trail

The
[`qlm_trail()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_trail.md)
function creates audit trails following Lincoln and Guba’s (1985)
framework for establishing trustworthiness in qualitative research. It
captures the complete decision history of your coding workflow.

## The audit trail concept

Lincoln and Guba (1985, p. 319-320) describe six categories of audit
trail materials for qualitative research:

1.  **Raw data**: Original texts
2.  **Data reduction products**: Summaries, coded results
3.  **Data reconstruction products**: Themes, comparisons, findings
4.  **Process notes**: Methodological decisions, procedures
5.  **Materials relating to intentions**: Research proposals, notes
6.  **Instrument development**: Codebooks, protocols

quallmer automatically captures these materials as you work:

| Component           | What quallmer stores                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Raw data            | Original texts in coded objects            |
| Data reduction      | Coded results from each run                |
| Data reconstruction | Comparison and validation results          |
| Process notes       | Model, temperature, timestamps, user notes |
| Intentions          | The R function calls you made              |
| Instruments         | Codebook instructions and schema           |

## How it works

Every quallmer object carries metadata about how it was created. The
trail system connects these objects to show your complete workflow:

    qlm_code()       →  Creates coded object with run metadata
          ↓
    qlm_backfill()   →  Completes the run; each pass is recorded on the same object
          ↓
    qlm_replicate()  →  Creates new object linked to parent
          ↓
    qlm_compare()    →  Creates comparison linked to inputs
          ↓
    qlm_trail()      →  Extracts and organizes all metadata

## Testing branches

After initial coding with
[`qlm_code()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_code.md),
the workflow branches into different types of quality assessment:

                               ┌─── a) Robustness (test-retest reliability)
                               │    qlm_replicate() → qlm_compare()
                               │
    qlm_code() ────────────────┼─── b) Reliability (test-test across models)
                               │    qlm_replicate(<alter settings>) → qlm_compare()
                               │
                               └─── c) Accuracy (vs. gold standard)
                                    qlm_validate()

**a) Robustness via repetition**: Run the same model and settings
multiple times to establish test-retest reliability. Use
[`qlm_replicate()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_replicate.md)
with identical settings, then
[`qlm_compare()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_compare.md)
to measure consistency.

**b) Reliability via different models**: Compare results across
different LLMs or temperatures to establish test-test reliability. Use
[`qlm_replicate()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_replicate.md)
with altered settings (e.g., different model, temperature), then
[`qlm_compare()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_compare.md)
to assess agreement.

**c) Accuracy versus a gold standard**: If human-coded gold standard
data exists, use
[`qlm_validate()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_validate.md)
to compute accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1, etc.).

[`qlm_trail()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_trail.md)
collects all these branches into a single trail object, providing a
complete record of what was tested and how the results compare.

## Creating a trail

Pass any quallmer objects to
[`qlm_trail()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_trail.md):

[`library`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)`(`[`quallmer`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/)`)`` `` ``# After your analysis...`` ``coded1`` ``<-`` `[`qlm_code`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_code.md)`(`` `` ``texts``, ``codebook``,`` `` model ``=`` ``"openai/gpt-4o"``,`` `` name ``=`` ``"gpt4o"``,`` `` notes ``=`` ``"Initial coding with GPT-4o"`` ``)`` `` ``coded2`` ``<-`` `[`qlm_replicate`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_replicate.md)`(`` `` ``coded1``,`` `` model ``=`` ``"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"``,`` `` name ``=`` ``"claude"``,`` `` notes ``=`` ``"Replication to check model agreement"`` ``)`` `` ``comparison`` ``<-`` `[`qlm_compare`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_compare.md)`(``coded1``, ``coded2``, by ``=`` ``sentiment``)`` `` ``# Create the audit trail`` ``trail`` ``<-`` `[`qlm_trail`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_trail.md)`(``coded1``, ``coded2``, ``comparison``)`` ``trail`

The print output shows:

- Run names and parent relationships
- Timestamps and model information
- Backfill passes, and any other model they used, so a run completed by
  two instruments is disclosed as one
- Notes documenting why each run was performed
- Comparison/validation summaries
- Whether the chain is complete

A run completed by
[`qlm_backfill()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_backfill.md)
says so in its trail. The object below ships with the package: a run
that came back with failures, backfilled once (the workflow guide walks
through it), so this runs without a key:

`examples`` ``<-`` `[`readRDS`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRDS.html)`(`[`system.file`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/system.file.html)`(``"extdata"``, ``"example_objects.rds"``, package ``=`` ``"quallmer"``)``)`` ``trail`` ``<-`` `[`qlm_trail`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_trail.md)`(``examples``$``example_coded_backfilled``)`` ``trail`` ``#> # quallmer audit trail`` ``#> Run: example_incomplete`` ``#> Created: 2026-09-04 21:01:37`` ``#> Model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`` ``#> Backfill: 1 pass, recovered 1 of 1`

The Quarto report described below carries the same line, as
**Backfill:** among the run’s process notes, and a pass costed on other
rates than the run gets a **Cost** line of its own.

## Saving the trail

Add a `path` argument to save permanent files:

[`qlm_trail`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_trail.md)`(``coded1``, ``coded2``, ``comparison``, path ``=`` ``"my_analysis"``)`

This creates:

- **my_analysis.rds**: Complete R object with all coded data
- **my_analysis.qmd**: Quarto document for human-readable documentation

## The Quarto report

The generated `.qmd` file contains:

1.  **Trail summary**: Number of runs, completeness status
2.  **Instrument development**: All codebooks used with instructions
3.  **Process notes**: Chronological record of each run
4.  **Data reconstruction**: Comparison and validation results
5.  **Replication section**: Code to reproduce the analysis

Render it with:

`quarto``::`[`quarto_render`](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-r/reference/quarto_render.html)`(``"my_analysis.qmd"``)`

## Loading saved trails

Reload a trail to access the data:

`trail`` ``<-`` `[`readRDS`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRDS.html)`(``"my_analysis.rds"``)`` `` ``# Access runs`` `[`names`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/names.html)`(``trail``$``runs``)`` `` ``# Get coded data from a run`` ``trail``$``runs``$``gpt4o``$``data`` `` ``# Check run metadata`` ``trail``$``runs``$``gpt4o``$``metadata``$``timestamp`` ``trail``$``runs``$``gpt4o``$``chat_args``$``name`

## Best practices

1.  **Name your runs**: Use the `name` parameter for readable trails
2.  **Add notes**: Use the `notes` parameter to document why each run
    was performed
3.  **Include all objects**: Pass every relevant object to
    [`qlm_trail()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_trail.md)
    for a complete chain
4.  **Save early**: Create trail files before sharing or publishing
    results
