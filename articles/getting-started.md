# Getting started with quallmer

The `quallmer` package helps qualitative researchers leverage the power
of large language models for tasks such as coding, annotation, and
thematic analysis. It is user-friendly and does not require extensive
programming knowledge, making it accessible to researchers from various
backgrounds.

Our tutorials provide a brief introduction to the `quallmer` package,
which is designed to facilitate the use of large language models (LLMs)
for qualitative research tasks. The package relies on the `ellmer`
package for LLM interactions, providing a seamless interface for users
to work with different LLM providers. For more information on the
`ellmer` package and supported LLM interactions, please refer to its
documentation [here](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/index.html).

## Basic usage

The `quallmer` package is developed for using it in R. Please make sure
you have a recent version of [R and RStudio
installed](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/#rstudio-ide-oss-downloads) on
your computer. If you are new to R and RStudio, you can find [a great
and free-of-charge 1.5h introduction to R and RStudio on
instats](https://instats.org/seminar/introduction-to-r-with-rstudio-free-1-h3).

To get started with `quallmer`, you first need to install the package
from GitHub.

`# If you don't have pak installed yet, uncomment and run the following line:`` ``# install.packages("pak")`` ``# Then, install quallmer using pak:`` ``pak``::`[`pak`](https://pak.r-lib.org/reference/pak.html)`(``"quallmer/quallmer"``)`

Then, you can load the package and begin using its functions.

## The quallmer workflow

The typical quallmer workflow consists of five steps:

1.  **Define** your codebook with
    [`qlm_codebook()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_codebook.md)
2.  **Code** your data with
    [`qlm_code()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_code.md),
    and complete a run that came back with failures using
    [`qlm_backfill()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_backfill.md)
3.  **Replicate** with different settings using
    [`qlm_replicate()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_replicate.md)
4.  **Compare** results with
    [`qlm_compare()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_compare.md)
5.  **Document** everything with
    [`qlm_trail()`](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/reference/qlm_trail.md)

For a hands-on introduction with code examples, see [**The quallmer
workflow**](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/getting-started/workflow.html).

## Setting up LLM access

Before using large language models, you need to set up access to an LLM
provider:

1.  [**Signing up for an OpenAI API
    key**](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/getting-started/openai.html):
    Obtain an API key from OpenAI to use models like GPT-4o.

2.  [**Working with an open-source Ollama
    model**](https://quallmer.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/getting-started/ollama.html):
    Use open-source models locally with Ollama.

The `quallmer` package supports multiple LLM providers through the
`ellmer` package. For more information, see the [ellmer
documentation](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/index.html).
