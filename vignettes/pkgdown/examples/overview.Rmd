Before creating your own tasks, you might want to explore the predefined tasks available in the `quallmer` package. These tasks are designed to streamline common annotation needs and can be easily integrated into your workflow. 

## Predefined tasks

The `quallmer` package currently includes the following predefined tasks:

| **Task** | **Function** | **Description** | **Output** |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| [**Sentiment analysis**](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/task_sentiment.html) | `task_sentiment()` | Rates overall sentiment of text. | Sentiment score (`-1` to `1`) and explanation |
| [**Stance detection**](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/task_stance.html) | `task_stance()` | Identifies stance/position taking toward a topic. | Stance label (pro/neutral/contra) and explanation |
| [**Ideological scaling**](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/task_ideology.html) | `task_ideology()` | Places text on an ideological scale (0–10) for a specified dimension. | Ideological score (`0` to `10`) and explanation |
| [**Topic salience**](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/task_salience.html) | `task_salience()` | Ranks salience of specified topics in text. | Ranked list of topics and explanation |



If you wish to create custom tasks tailored to your specific research questions and data types, you can use the `task()` function. This function allows you to specify the system prompt and output structure, enabling you to customize the annotation process according to your needs.
