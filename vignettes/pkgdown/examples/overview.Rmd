Before creating your own tasks, you might want to explore the predefined tasks available in the `quallmer` package. These tasks are designed to streamline common annotation needs and can be easily integrated into your workflow. 

## Predefined tasks

The `quallmer` package currently includes the following predefined tasks:

- [**Sentiment analysis**](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/sentiment.html): The `sentiment()` task allows you to rate the sentiment of texts on a scale from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive), along with a brief explanation.

- [**Thematic coding**](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/themes.html): The `themes()` task helps identify and categorize themes within textual data.

- [**Stance detection**](https://seraphinem.github.io/quallmer/articles/pkgdown/examples/stance.html): The `stance()` task assesses the stance of a text towards a specific topic or issue.

If you wish to create custom tasks tailored to your specific research questions and data types, you can use the `define_task()` function. This function allows you to specify the system prompt and output structure, enabling you to customize the annotation process according to your needs.
