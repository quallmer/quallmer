Our `quallmer` package includes the Agreement App, a user-friendly interface that allows researchers to manually code data, review LLM-generated annotations, and calculate intercoder reliability scores such as Krippendorff's alpha and Fleiss' kappa. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of using the Agreement App effectively.

## Launching the Agreement App
To launch the Agreement App, you can use the `agreement_app()` function from the `quallmer` package. Make sure you have the package loaded in your R environment. Then, simply call the `agreement_app()` function. This will open the Agreement App in a new window or tab in your web browser.

## Using the Agreement App for manual coding

Once the Agreement App is launched, you can start by uploading your dataset. The app supports .csv or .rds file formats. After uploading your data, you can select the column containing the content (e.g., texts, images, etc.) you want to manually assess. While using the app, you can manually assign a score or comments to each text item based on your coding scheme. You can also save example sentences from each text item to help you remember your coding decisions later or as illustrative examples for your research.

## Reviewing LLM-generated annotations

If you have previously used the `quallmer` package to generate annotations using large language models (LLMs), you can upload those annotations into the Agreement App for review. The app allows you to check the LLM-generated codes alongside justifications provided by the model. You can then decide whether to accept these annotations as `valid` or `invalid`, or modify them based on your assessment by adding comments and example sentences.

## Calculating intercoder reliability

After completing the manual coding and reviewing the LLM-generated annotations, the Agreement App provides functionality to calculate intercoder reliability scores. You can choose from various metrics, such as Krippendorff's alpha or Fleiss' kappa, to assess the agreement between different coders or between your manual codes and the LLM annotations or, as shown below, between multiple LLM runs.

The app provides an intuitive interface for navigating through the data and making coding decisions. **All your coding decisions will be saved automatically, you find it in a newly created folder named "agreement" in your working directory.**
