#' * `response_format` is a raw body field for APIs that support it. Passing

#' here. A test asserts the set is currently disjoint from the candidates, so

#' Reject a model parameter passed at the top level
#'
#' A top-level `temperature` or `max_tokens` falls through to `chat_args` and
#' reaches [ellmer::chat()], which has no such argument, so the call died with
#' `unused argument (max_tokens = 100)` raised from inside ellmer -- naming the
#' argument but neither of the two places it could have gone.
#'
#' Deliberately does not say which of the two to use. The choice is not a
#' property of the name: `top_k` is a real [ellmer::params()] field, but ellmer
#' maps it onto `top_logprobs` for OpenAI-compatible providers, so a caller who
#' wants a provider's raw `top_k` needs `api_args` and one who wants ellmer's
#' standardised form needs `params`. Naming both and letting the caller pick is
#' the honest message. The two aliases are unambiguous and do get a specific
